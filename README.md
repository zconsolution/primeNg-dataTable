PrimeNg Basic Data Table Implementation

To use this basic data table code:

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory.

2) Type: npm install This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.

3) Type: ng serve This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application. 

It will be running on http://localhost:4200.
